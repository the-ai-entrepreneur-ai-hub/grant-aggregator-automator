Every scraper uses the same intelligent keyword matching engine (`keyword_matcher.py`) to ensure consistent relevance scoring:

#### Keyword Categories (160+ total):

**Geographic Keywords (32):**
- Primary: Peru, Per√∫, Andean region, Ancash Province
- Regional: Highland communities, rural Peru, indigenous territories
- Broader: Latin America, South America

**Program Areas (57):**
- **Education**: Rural education, digital inclusion, adult literacy
- **Economic**: Microfinance, agricultural cooperatives, rural entrepreneurship

- **Agriculture**: Sustainable farming, climate-smart agriculture
- **Infrastructure**: Rural electrification, water access, digital connectivity

**Target Beneficiaries (18):**
- Indigenous communities, Quechua populations, rural women
- Smallholder farmers, mountain dwellers, vulnerable groups

**Priority Indicators (17):**
- Peru eligibility, rural focus, community-based
- Grassroots organizations, indigenous-led initiatives

**Exclusion Criteria (20):**
- Urban only, developed countries only, commercial ventures only
- US citizens only, academic organizations only

#### Scoring Algorithm:

```python
# Weighted scoring by category
category_weights = {
    'GEOGRAPHIC': 3.0,      # Highest - geographic relevance
    'PROGRAM_AREA': 2.5,    # High - program alignment  
    'BENEFICIARY': 2.0,     # Medium-high - target population
    'FUNDING_TYPE': 1.5,    # Medium - funding category
    'PRIORITY': 1.8,        # Medium-high - priority indicators
    'EXCLUSION': -5.0       # Strong negative - exclusions
}

total_score = sum(category_scores[cat] * weights[cat] for cat in categories)
```

#### Relevance Levels:
- **8.0-10.0**: CRITICAL - Strong Peru geographic + program alignment
- **6.0-7.9**: HIGH - Good alignment with Mission Huascaran
- **4.5-5.9**: MEDIUM - Worth reviewing, moderate relevance  
- **3.0-4.4**: LOW - Some relevance, lower priority
- **<3.0**: MINIMAL - Filtered out

## üéõÔ∏è Orchestrator System (`scraper_orchestrator.py`)

### Central Management

The orchestrator coordinates all scrapers with intelligent management:

#### Execution Flow:
1. **Initialize all scrapers** with proper async context management
2. **Execute concurrently** with rate limiting (max 2 concurrent)
3. **Retry failed scrapers** up to 3 attempts with backoff
4. **Collect all opportunities** from successful scraping sessions
5. **Apply keyword matching** to score relevance for each opportunity
6. **Deduplicate similar opportunities** using title similarity
7. **Filter by relevance threshold** (default 3.0+)
8. **Sort by relevance score** (highest first)
9. **Save to Airtable** with full metadata
10. **Generate comprehensive report** in JSON format

#### Performance Features:
- **Concurrent Processing**: Runs multiple scrapers simultaneously
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects target sites with 2-5 second delays
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of async resources
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed execution logs for monitoring

#### Configuration Options:
```python
config = {
    'max_concurrent_scrapers': 2,
    'retry_attempts': 3,
    'retry_delay': 5,  # seconds
    'relevance_threshold': 3.0,
    'max_opportunities_per_source': 50,
    'enable_airtable_save': True,
    'enable_deduplication': True
}
```

## üìä Data Pipeline & Integration

### Airtable Integration

All scrapers feed into a unified Airtable pipeline:

#### Record Structure:
```json

  "Grant Name": "Rural Education Initiative for Indigenous Communities",
  "Organization": ["Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)"],
  "Description": "Supporting digital inclusion and literacy programs...",
  "Amount": "$2 million",
  "Deadline": "2025-05-15",
  "Category": ["Education", "Rural Development"],
  "Keywords": ["Peru", "indigenous communities", "rural education"],
  "Eligibility": "NGOs working with indigenous communities",
  "Application Link": "https://www.iadb.org/...",
  "Status": "Active",
  "Priority": "HIGH", 
  "Notes": "Relevance Score: 8.5. Auto-scraped via Orchestrator.",
  "Source": "IDB"
}
```

#### Data Quality Features:
- **Deduplication**: Removes similar opportunities using title similarity
- **Text Cleaning**: Normalizes and truncates long descriptions
- **Link Validation**: Ensures application URLs are properly formatted
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Adds keyword matches, scores, and timestamps
